#+TITLE: Scallop

* Scallop

Scallop is a sandbox plaything for me to do some lualatex stuff in.

** What's going on here?

This project is rendered to a pdf with this command:

#+begin_src shell
lualatex --interaction=nonstopmode scallop.tex
#+end_src

This will generate a ~pdf~. Here you can see it references ~scallop.tex~, but the content of the document is actually found in the ~fnl~ code.

The ~scallop.tex~ file is very simple, it just loads the ~init.lua~ file:

#+begin_src latex
\directlua{dofile("init.lua")}
#+end_src

~init.lua~ is not much more complicated, it set's up Fennel and calls ~init()~ from the ~init-scallop~ module:
#+begin_src lua
local fennel = require("fennel")
table.insert(package.loaders or package.searchers, fennel.searcher)
local init = require("init-scallop")
init.init()
#+end_src

[[./init-scallop.fnl][~init-scallop~]] is where we actually start building our document. First, our ~scallop~ module, (the one with the content) is required. It's ~preamble~ and ~inner~ functions are called, and the ~document~ is ~begin~ and ~end~ around the inner content.

Various tex helpers written in [[./scallop-tex.fnl][~scallop-tex~]].


TODO: Explain using ~write~ and direct node manipulation and how it can be easily interspersed with other content.
